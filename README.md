#1. What is AngularJS?
AngularJS is a javascript framework used for creating single web page applications.  It allows you to use HTML as your template language and enables you to extend HTML’s syntax to express your application’s components clearly.

#2. What is the difference between one-way binding and two-way binding?
– One way binding implies that the scope variable in the html will be set to the first value its model is bound to (i.e. assigned to)
– Two way binding implies that the scope variable will change it’s value every time its model is assigned to a different value .
